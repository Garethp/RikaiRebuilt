## Version 1.1.5

#### Deinflection
Two things changed with this version. First of all, I swapped the deinflection code that I originally had with the
deinflection code from rikaichamp. Secondly, I fixed some issues where RikaiRebuilt was ignoring if a dictionary was a 
name dictionary or contained the types of words in it's definition. With these two combined, hopefully deinflection as
a whole will be more stable

#### Dictionary Swapping
You know how previously you had to move your mouse after changing your dictionary, or going to epwing/sanseido mode? No
more. Just change the dictionary/mode and the popup should change itself!
