## Version 1.1.0

#### Basic EPWING support
So this is basically a massive update for a small piece of EPWING functionality. And I do mean small. You can set a
(single) EPWING dictionary to use and use it. No multiple dictionaries yet, no support for extra options, no showing
the name of the dictionary you selected, no guarantee of being stable. That being said, the amount of work that's been
put in to making it work is rather large. It's also probably the biggest feature *since* starting this project, so
that's why I'm giving it the `1.1` tag.
