## Version 1.2.0

#### Technical Changes
The major change for this release isn't a feature change, but rather a technical one. RikaiRebuilt has been entirely
rewritten in TypeScript, which means that it now has much better typing and error checking. Additionally, the code
has been cleaned up quite a bit. There's still way more cleaning up to go on, but this is a massive step forward in
making sure that the code is more readable and maintainable.
