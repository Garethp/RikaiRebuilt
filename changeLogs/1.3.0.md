## Version 1.3.0

#### Visual Novel Hook Feature
In Version 1.3.0, there's a new feature for Visual Novel Hooks. Following some setup guides for VN Hooking, you might
end up with a plugin for monitoring your clipboard, an HTML file that you have to autoscroll as your clipboard is
injected and then a Rikai plugin to read from that page. Now, RikaiRebuilt does all of that for you.

There's a new Visual Novel Hook page that will do the Clipboard Injecting and auto scrolling, so you don't need three
separate tools just for that part of the Hooking.
