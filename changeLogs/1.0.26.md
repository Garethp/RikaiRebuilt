## Version 1.0.26

#### Small fixes in the Sanseido Mode Fallback
This version consists basically of just this fix. What was happening was that when I initiated the Sanseido Lookup, it
didn't reset the fallback state of Sanseido Mode. What does this mean? Well, let's say the first time you use Sanseido
Mode you look at 過去, and it works fine. It gets the definition for 過去. The next time, you decide to look at the reading
for the word (or any word, actually. So long as it's the reading, not the Dictionary Format), such as かこ. Well, it
looks at the Sanseido page for かこ and loads up the definition, since we're looking at Reading Mode now.

Problem is, without setting it back *from* Reading Mode, the next time we look at 過去, Sanseido does a lookup on the
*reading* of 過去, which is かこ. Since we only want to look at the reading if we can't find a definition for the Dictionary
 Format, we need to reset it before we do the lookup.

 There were some other small fixes with the fallback state, but I'm not sure what bugs those might have been causing
