## Version 1.1.3

#### Webpack
I'd like to move towards a better structure, and maybe even use other people's code. One of the piece of code I'm interested
in borrowing is written in TypeScript. So for that reason everything is going to be compiled with Babel and Webpack.
Hopefully it won't cause issues, but you know how these things go.

#### Bugfixes
The bug that annoys me the most right now is that every time I open my browser it looks like RikaiRebuilt is enabled. That's
because it never really resets the icon when the browser is opened. Since the icon was last set to enabled (for me), it
stayed enabled even though RikaiRebuilt wasn't enabled at all. That should be fixed.
