## Version 1.1.7

#### Name Dictionary
Due to the changes in the structure of variant candidates when swapping over to the deinflection of Rikaichamp, and the
fact that I didn't change the structure of the empty candidate for names, trying to look up names didn't work. This
really goes to show that I need to more fully migrate to a better codebase, and one in Typescript. Better typing
(or any typing at all) would have caught this issue long before I released it.
