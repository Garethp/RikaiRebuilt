## Version 1.1.6

#### Dictionaries
It turns out that if you tried to install multiple dictionaries in Firefox it would throw an error and hang on 99%.
The cause of this turned out to be the fact that the dictionary config was being passed by reference to `data.js`, which
meant that when it attached and opened an IndexedDb, that got attached to the config. So when we tried to update the
browser storage with a new dictionary, it was also trying to put the entire IndexedDb into the browser storage, and threw
an error. The solution was to do a shallow clone in `data.js` with `Object.assign`, so that attaching a DB doesn't affect
anything else. Hopefully this should improve memory usage in Chrome and Firefox.

#### Extracting Sentences
I'm not really sure what was going on there. I must have screwed something up when merging Yomichans textSource with
the sentence extracting from Rikaisama. Hopefully it should be better now
