## Rikai Rebuilt

#### What is it?
Rikai Rebuilt is an attempt to rewrite the Firefox extension [Rikaisama](http://rikaisama.sourceforge.net/)
for the WebExtension API since the XUL API that Rikaisama was built with doesn't work in Firefox anymore

#### How is this different to the other Rikaisama Alternatives
Rather than trying to be an alternative, this plugin will try to be as true to the original as possible,
attempting to keep the logic and functionality the same by rewriting it line by line. On top of that,
the end goal is to have this extension be compatible with all browsers that support WebExtension
